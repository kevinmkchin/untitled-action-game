I will put more docs here as various engine systems or foundations become more concrete. Things will change quickly and dramatically during development, so I should only document things that are mostly finished or really important.

As the shading model for my game becomes finalized (e.g. lighting solution for world, lighting solution for characters/models, etc.) I will document how the shading model works here.
