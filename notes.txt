gamma slider at the start of the game


final level is only accessible if you played previous games well. like commando. final level is bonus level to get the true ending.


Lightmap post processing step to fill in black texels using surrounding texels. Also moving the hemicube sample point if the texel is half occluded.

Incrementally release engine improvements as whole new games but really short and choose your price/free. This way I can improve every aspect of the game little by little until the whole engine and game is awesome.


Love Death Robots Secret War vibes nazi Russia occult black magic human sacrifices bring hell demons to Earth. The Ancient Ones, the Old Gods. Fight the ancient one at the end as nazis try to free it. Ending is that you are locked in an eternal battle. Must fight the ancient one for eternity like Diablo 2 Mephisto.



Fun ideas
    FOV slider in game up to insane value like 170
    Allow turning bilinear filtering for light maps off

== The fucking stuttering issue (CPU GPU SYNC ISSUES) ==

having glFinish after SDL_GL_SwapWindow introduced a lot of random stutter (with vsync on)...i feel like i'm still getting some stutter from time to time but never as bad as it was with glFinish...also renderdoc.dll??? i'm not sure

Okay, putting 10ms sleep before tick time with vsnc off makes strafing always stutter nvm wtf sometimes it does sometimes it doesnt....uhhh maybe its cuz then CPU takes much longer than GPU, so GPU ends up finishing 
```
    while (!ProgramShutdownRequested)
    {
        Sleep(10);
        TickTime();
        GUI::NewFrame();
        ProcessSDLEvents();
```
OKAY SO BASICALLY CPU-GPU SYNCHRONIZATION IS VERY IMPORTANT BOTH NEED TO BE BALANCED
IF ONE OR OTHER TAKES MUCH LONGER THAN CAN CAUSE ISSUES LIKE FRAME TIME FLUCTUATION / JITTER
OR STUTTER AND INPUT LAG

I NEED TO BALANCE CPU AND GPU WORKLOADS AND MANAGE FRAME PACING AND SYNCHRONIZATION.
I'm gonna need to switch to Vulkan eventually. It provides explicit control over frame pacing and outperforms opengl.
