- perhaps, we can use RTX on ray tracing supported GPU to bake the lighting data
  instead of using hemicube sampling

- to learn NVIDIA OptiX, try using it to calculate direct lighting which should be simple.
  I'm already doing a version of this on the CPU. 
- then monte carlo sampling with lots of samples per iteration
  output radiance = direct lighting + average from monte carlo samples attenuated

- OptiX 8.1 SDK requires CUDA Toolkit to build
- I should make my lightmapper a separate program so I only have to build with CUDA once.
- Then, the lightmapper just needs to be linked with my stuff

gamma slider at the start of the game


final level is only accessible if you played previous games well. like commando. final level is bonus level to get the true ending.


Lightmap post processing step to fill in black texels using surrounding texels. Also moving the hemicube sample point if the texel is half occluded.

Incrementally release engine improvements as whole new games but really short and choose your price/free. This way I can improve every aspect of the game little by little until the whole engine and game is awesome.

Fun ideas
    FOV slider in game up to insane value like 170
    Allow turning bilinear filtering for light maps off
